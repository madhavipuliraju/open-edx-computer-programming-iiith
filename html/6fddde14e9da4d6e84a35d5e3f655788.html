<h2>Introduction to Functions</h2><hr>
<p>Functions enable modular decomposition of large programs. They allow reuse and improve readability and maintainability of programs. When constructed properly, functions also enable reasoning about their properties. A function typically receives arguments and returns a value. This experiment shows function definition and invocation within a program. </p>
