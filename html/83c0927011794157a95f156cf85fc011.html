<h2>Introduction to Numerical Approximation</h2><hr>
<p>
This experiment demonstrates the idea that one can attain a perfect solution in the limit by suucessively computing approximations to the exact value. The intent behind this experiment is to make use of ideas laerned in the previous experiments. This is intended to introduce the student to numerical methods..
