<h2>Introduction to Strings</h2><hr>
<p>Strings in the C programming language are represented by a sequence of characters terminated by an ASCII zero ('\0') character. Strings are processed using a character pointer that traverses the string from one end to the other. The ANSI C standard defines a standard string library containing useful functions. This experiment demonstrates the use of these functions.</p>
