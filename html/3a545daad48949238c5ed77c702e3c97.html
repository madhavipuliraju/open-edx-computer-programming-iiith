<h2>Introduction to Recursion</h2><hr>
<p>  Many data structures are self-similar at different levels. Many operations over such data are naturally expressed as operations that repetitively process diminishing parts of such data. In many cases, ieration can be naturally viwed as a function that reflexively applies itself on the data. This experiment is intended to demonstrate the use of recursion in programs.</p>
