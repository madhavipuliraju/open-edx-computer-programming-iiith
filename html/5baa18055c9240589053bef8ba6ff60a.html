<p>Evaluating an expression is one of the most common tasks in programming. For example a+b+c is an expression. Here + is an operator. The variables a, b and c are operands. The value of the expression is the sum of a, b and c. An expression may be often evaluated to assign a variable a new value or to verify the truthfulness of a test condition. For example the operator can be unary(Ex: ~,++ etc.), binary(Ex: +,* etc.) or ternary (Ex: (a&gt;b)?p:q)</p>
