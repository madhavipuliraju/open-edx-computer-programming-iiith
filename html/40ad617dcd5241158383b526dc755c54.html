          A string is a sequence of characters -- it can contain a word, your name, a sentence, a paragraph or even an entire composition. A question that arises is that how the contents of a string can be stored. An array of characters seems like a very good choice. Apart from allowing you to store strings, C programming language provides you a large collection of associated string manipulation functions under the string.h library. These functions will allow you to treat strings like variables and allow operations like addition(concatenation) of two strings, searching a string in another string, compare two strings etc.
