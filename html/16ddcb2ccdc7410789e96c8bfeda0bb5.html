<h2>Introduction to Basic Control Flow</h2><hr>
Computer programs employ control structures such as conditional statements, multi-way branches and iteration. This experiment allows the student to execute programs that use if-then-else statements and switch-case statements. The execution of a program is animated and the intermediate results are displayed in seperate output sections for better comprehension.
